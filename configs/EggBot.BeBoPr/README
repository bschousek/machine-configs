This configuration drives an EggBot style printer, mostly crafted from
the "Improved printable eggbot" by nglasson:

http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:263668

Using a BeagleBone Black, a BeBoPr + Bridge cape, two Pololu type
stepper drivers, and a small R/C servo.

The X axis controlls the rotation of the egg

The Y axis controlls the angle of the pen

The Z axis controlls pen up/down

Current X and Y settings are appropriate for a typical EggBot style
printer and Inkscape plug-in, with the following settings, chosen to
map the default EggBot Inkscape template reasonably into mm:

X = 360 degrees :  -160.0 to +160.0 mm
Y =  90 degrees :   -40.0 to  +40.0 mm
Z =  arbitrary  :    -5.0 to   +5.0 mm for full servo travel

Typical Z values used:
  Pen Down = -1.0
  Pen Up   = +1.0
  Zero Z and adjust pen as needed for whatever you are drawing on 

Typical Inkscape 3200x800 px image needs to be scaled to print correctly
with this setup.  See EggBot.HOWTO.txt for details on generating gcode
from a vector image.
